# Fakebook
Fakebook is a monolithic web application that parodies the Facebook social media platform. I created this project to enhance my knowledge of the Flask framework.

## Description
The primary purpose of Fakebook is to satirically highlight the divisive nature of social media. Fakebook allows users to find and monitor their "enemies" while staying updated on their activities. Additionally, it provides a platform for creating and organizing communities focused on topics like military technologies.
